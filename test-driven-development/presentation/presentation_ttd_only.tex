\begin{frame}{Agenda}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item 2022-02-02: Unit test and test driven development
  \item 2022-02-09: Continuous integration and automated tests on github
 \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why testing?}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item To not ask yourself why you did not test when your code does not work 2 weeks before a project's end
  \item To feel confident that your code is doing what you are expecting from it
 \end{enumerate}

 Coding without testing is like climbing without rope: it is fun and you feel free, but it is risky and you can hurt yourself badly :(

\begin{frame}{Unit Tests: Idea}
Goal:
\begin{itemize}
\item Isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct
\item Allows refactoring of code at a later date, and makes sure the module is still working correctly
\end{itemize}
How:
\begin{itemize}
\item Many small independent and isolated tests
\item Automated tests run by developer
\item Used in TDD
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unit Tests: Rules}
Unit tests should be:
\begin{description}

\item[small] e.g. concentrate on single criteria, so that failing of a test directly points to underlying error \\
Rule of thumb: Consider if the test is a logical AND between conditions or a logical OR . In the former case go for multiple assertions, in the latter create multiple test functions.
\item[fast] in order to run whole test set after each change/save to the code
\item[idempotent] e.g. should be order-independent and not rely on each other
\item[isolated] e.g. should be independent of environment or external APIs
\end{description}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Other Tests}
\begin{description}
\item[Integration Test] \hfill\\
Occurs after unit testing; combines multiple unit tests to a group and tests group outcome.\\
Example:\\
Login at GUI $\rightarrow$ API call $\rightarrow$ DB check $\rightarrow$ login
\item[Regression Test] \hfill \\
Re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.
\item[Smoke Test] \hfill\\
Smoke tests are a subset of test cases that cover the most important functionality of a component or system, used to aid assessment of whether main functions of the software appear to work correctly.

\begin{frame}{Now some demonstration}
We have the requirements to write a function which can add up numbers. Let's do it following the TTD philosophy, step by step.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Follow-up: next workshop}
Everyone is welcome to join

\vspace{15pt}

It will happen on 2022-02-09 1230-1400 and we will see what type of tests one could implement on an existing repository and how to setup automated tests with github actions.
